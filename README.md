Welcome to LingoSwitch, the tool reviving the intuitive vertical-language switcher from macOS Ventura. For those who prefer the simplicity and familiarity of the old switcher.

## Current Features

- **Ventura-style Vertical List**: Activates with the "üåê" key, bringing back the Ventura experience.
- **Background Operation**: Stays active without interfering with your workflow.
- **Language Switching**: Effortlessly change keyboard languages.
- **Smart Language Sorting**: Prioritize languages based on usage.
- **Login Integration**: Launch LingoSwitch automatically upon system startup.
- **Persistent Pop-Up**: Repeated "üåê" key presses extend display time.

## Roadmap

- ~~**Smart Language Sorting**: Prioritize languages based on usage.~~ (Done)
- ~~**Login Integration**: Launch LingoSwitch automatically upon system startup.~~ (Done)
- **Typing Detection**: Autohiding the Pop-Up Window on Keypress (In Progress)
- **Adding Customisation**: Hotkeys for Quick Swapping, Adjusting the Window Delay

## Quick Start

1. Go to Settings > Keyboard and set "Press "üåê"-Key" to "Do Nothing".
2. Go to the "Releases"-Tab and download the latest ZIP.
3. Extract and launch LingoSwitch.app.
4. Move to "Applications". (optionally)

## What's Next?

My goal is to refine LingoSwitch, incorporating all Ventura features.
